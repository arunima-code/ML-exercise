Problem 6.1 (Predicting Air Quality) (100 P.)


In this final exercise sheet, you will perform regression of time series data by building up the entire
machine learning from scratch. Download the dataset, invesstiagte its contents, perform appropriate preprocessing,
choose a learning algorithm, tune the hyperparamters, and train a final model. Report the
achieved results on the provided training set in the best way you see fit. The dataset contains various
air quality and weather measurements from five different Chinese cities collected during a period of four
years. Your trained model needs to predict the concentration of PM2.5 at any given city for a given time,
i.e., the inputs to your predictor consist of the tuple (city, day, month, year, hour) and the output is the
predicted PM2.5 concentration in ug/m3. As always, you need to document your choices and
your process! Write a full report on your experiments and results. Please note the following:
a) For this task, you need to put everything that you have learned during this course together, so it
might be advisable to review the content of previous lectures as well.
b) You may use any additional Python libraries that you see fit as long as you provide links and
references.
c) For grading, we will put significantly higher focus on your report than the actual achieved performance.
Make sure to explain your choices (algorithms, preprocessing, model, loss function,
experiments, hyperparameters).
d) You may not use any other data points than the ones we provided.
